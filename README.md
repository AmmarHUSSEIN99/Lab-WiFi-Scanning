# Lab-WiFi-Scanning

# Lab 01 – Wi-Fi Scanning and Bluetooth Tools

This project was developed as part of the *Mobile and Sensor Networks* course at Politecnico di Torino, during the second semester of the master's degree program. It was carried out in a group (Group 05) and focuses on exploring wireless communication tools in Linux-based environments.

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this lab was to:
- Identify and configure wireless interfaces
- Perform scanning and monitoring of nearby Wi-Fi Access Points
- Analyze wireless signal quality in different physical locations
- Use Linux tools for Bluetooth Classic and BLE scanning

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- `ifconfig`, `iwconfig`, `iw dev`
- `traceroute`, `ip`, `iwlist`
- `LinSSID` (GUI-based Wi-Fi scanning)
- `hciconfig`, `hcitool`, `btmgmt`, `lescan` (Bluetooth tools)

---

## 📋 What We Did

- Identified network interfaces and configured monitor mode
- Used command-line and GUI tools to perform Wi-Fi scans
- Collected Wi-Fi signal strength and channel data
- Created visual floor plan maps to evaluate signal coverage
- Compared Bluetooth Classic and BLE scanning techniques
- Tested device compatibility for BLE operations
